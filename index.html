Step 3: Nodes validate the transaction using the network's consensus rules. Step 4: Valid transactions are grouped into a block with a cryptographic hash.

Blockchain is decentralized with no single point of control, fully transparent with all transactions publicly verifiable, settles in minutes, and operates 24/7/365 without downtime."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A smart contract is a self-executing program stored on the blockchain that automatically runs when predetermined conditions are met. Written in languages like Solidity (Ethereum) or Rust (Solana), smart contracts eliminate middlemen, run transparently on-chain, and cannot be altered after deployment. They power DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and thousands of decentralized applications."

        "text": "Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and processes ~7 transactions per second using Proof of Work. Ethereum was launched in 2015 as a programmable blockchain that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum processes ~15 TPS using Proof of Stake (since The Merge in 2022) and hosts the majority of all DeFi value, stablecoins, and DAO activity."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The Bitcoin blockchain has never been successfully hacked in over 15 years of operation. Each Ethereum block uses keccak-256 cryptographic hashing and is linked to every previous block. A 51% attack on Ethereum's PoS would require an attacker to control 51% of all staked ETH — currently worth $40B+, making it economically self-defeating. However, smart contracts, bridges, and exchanges built on top of blockchains can have vulnerabilities."

Energy consumption dropped 99.95% overnight. Validators stake 32 ETH as collateral, earning ~4% APY for honest behavior. Misbehave and your stake gets "slashed." The most complex upgrade ever executed on a live $200B network.</div>

        <div class="scard-text">Ethereum's PoS consensus protocol is called Gasper — a combination of Casper FFG (finality gadget) and LMD-GHOST (fork choice rule). Validators are organized into committees that vote on blocks every 12 seconds. Every 6.4 minutes (an "epoch" of 32 slots), finality is achieved — making those blocks cryptographically irreversible. No miner can rewrite finalized Ethereum history.</div>

        <div class="scard-text">Yield farming involves lending or staking crypto assets in DeFi protocols to earn rewards.

        <div class="scard-text">TerraUSD (UST) relied on algorithmic minting/burning to maintain its $1 peg — no real collateral. In May 2022, UST lost its peg causing a "death spiral" that wiped $40B in value in 72 hours. This destroyed Luna, a top-10 coin. The collapse triggered a global crypto market crash and regulatory crackdowns worldwide.</div>

          <p>Imagine a Google Doc that thousands of people share — except nobody can edit or delete old entries, only add new ones. That's blockchain. It's a <strong style="color:#627EEA;">shared, digital ledger</strong> that records transactions across a global network of computers. No bank, government, or company controls it — the network itself enforces the rules through mathematics and code.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:8px;">Every entry is called a <strong style="color:#627EEA;">block</strong>, and each block is locked to the previous one with a unique cryptographic code called a <strong style="color:#627EEA;">hash</strong>. This creates a chain of blocks — a blockchain. Change anything in one block and every block after it breaks. That's what makes it tamper-proof.</p>

          <p><strong style="color:#627EEA;">Step 1 — Initiation:</strong> A user creates a transaction (e.g. sending Bitcoin) and digitally signs it with their private key using cryptographic mathematics.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:6px;"><strong style="color:#627EEA;">Step 2 — Broadcast:</strong> The signed transaction is immediately broadcast to thousands of nodes across the global peer-to-peer network.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:6px;"><strong style="color:#627EEA;">Step 3 — Validation:</strong> Nodes verify the digital signature, confirm the sender has sufficient funds, and check for double-spending attempts.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:6px;"><strong style="color:#627EEA;">Step 4 — Block Formation:</strong> Valid transactions are bundled into a new block containing a Merkle root, the previous block's hash, a timestamp, and a nonce.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:6px;"><strong style="color:#627EEA;">Step 5 — Consensus:</strong> Miners (PoW) or validators (PoS) compete to finalize the block according to the network's consensus rules.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:6px;"><strong style="color:#627EEA;">Step 6 — Finality:</strong> The confirmed block is added to the chain permanently. After 32 confirmations on Ethereum (~6.4 minutes), the transaction is considered irreversible forever.</p>

          <p><strong style="color:#627EEA;">Blockchain is the technology. Bitcoin is one application of that technology.</strong></p>
          <p style="margin-top:8px;">Think of blockchain like the internet — a foundational technology. Bitcoin is like email — one specific application built on it. Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and thousands of other cryptocurrencies are all separate blockchains. They share the underlying principles (decentralization, cryptography, consensus) but differ in their design, speed, functionality, and purpose.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:8px;">Bitcoin was specifically designed as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Ethereum was designed as a programmable blockchain for smart contracts. You can have blockchain without Bitcoin, but you cannot have Bitcoin without blockchain.</p>

          <p>A smart contract is a <strong style="color:#627EEA;">self-executing program stored permanently on the blockchain</strong>. Think of it as a vending machine — you put in money, the machine checks the conditions (correct amount, item in stock), and automatically delivers what you paid for. No staff, no manager, no possibility of human error or corruption.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:8px;">Smart contracts are written in programming languages like <strong style="color:#627EEA;">Solidity</strong> (Ethereum) or <strong style="color:#627EEA;">Rust</strong> (Solana). Once deployed, they cannot be altered. They run automatically when their conditions are triggered — powering DeFi loans, stablecoin issuance, token swaps, insurance payouts, DAO governance, and more. Ethereum alone hosts over 50 million smart contracts.</p>

          <p>The <strong style="color:#627EEA;">Bitcoin blockchain has never been successfully attacked</strong> in over 15 years. To alter the Bitcoin blockchain, an attacker would need to control more than 51% of the global hash rate — requiring more computational power than the world's 500 fastest supercomputers combined. The cost would exceed billions of dollars, and the attacker would destroy the very value they're trying to steal.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:8px;">However, <strong style="color:#627EEA;">applications built on top of blockchains can be hacked</strong> — including smart contract bugs ($5B+ lost in DeFi), bridge vulnerabilities ($625M Ronin hack), exchange hacks (FTX collapse), and phishing attacks on individual wallets. The underlying blockchain protocol is extremely secure; it's the software built on it that carries risk.</p>

          <p><strong style="color:#627EEA;">Proof of Work (PoW):</strong> Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The winner earns the right to add the next block and receives a Bitcoin reward. This is extremely energy-intensive (~150 TWh/year for Bitcoin) but provides the strongest security through massive real-world resource expenditure. Used by Bitcoin and Litecoin.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:8px;"><strong style="color:#627EEA;">Proof of Stake (PoS):</strong> Validators lock up (stake) their own cryptocurrency as collateral. They are randomly selected to validate blocks proportional to their stake. Malicious behavior results in their stake being "slashed." Uses 99.9% less energy than PoW. Used by Ethereum (since The Merge in 2022), Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot.</p>

        <div class="scard-title">What a Smart Contract Is</div>
        <div class="scard-text">A smart contract is a program deployed to a blockchain that executes automatically when conditions are met — like a vending machine for value. Once deployed it cannot be modified. No judge, no lawyer, no intermediary. Code is the contract and the executor simultaneously. Ethereum hosts 50M+ smart contracts powering $200B+ in DeFi value.</div>

        <p>Ethereum staking lets you earn yield on your ETH by participating in network validation. You lock up ETH (32 ETH to run your own validator, or any amount through liquid staking protocols like Lido, Rocket Pool, or Coinbase cbETH) and earn ~3–5% APY in ETH rewards for helping secure the network.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">Liquid staking tokens (stETH, rETH) are tradeable representations of your staked ETH. They continue earning yield while remaining usable in DeFi. <strong style="color:#627EEA;">Over 34M ETH is currently staked</strong> — nearly 30% of total supply — generating billions in annual yield paid to validators who secure Ethereum.</p>

        <p><strong style="color:#627EEA;">Optimistic Rollups</strong> (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base) assume transactions are valid by default and only run a "fraud proof" if someone challenges a transaction. They have a 7-day withdrawal period to L1 but are EVM-equivalent, making it easy to port existing Ethereum dApps. Arbitrum alone processes more transactions daily than Ethereum mainnet.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;"><strong style="color:#627EEA;">Layer 2 (L2)</strong> networks sit on top of L1 and process transactions off-chain before batching them to L1 for finality. Optimistic Rollups (Optimism, Arbitrum) assume transactions are valid and only verify if challenged. ZK-Rollups (zkSync, StarkNet, Polygon zkEVM) use zero-knowledge proofs for instant mathematical verification. L2s achieve 1,000–100,000+ TPS while inheriting L1 security.</p>

      <div style="padding:0 18px 16px;font-size:13px;color:rgba(255,255,255,.78);line-height:1.7;">
        <p>EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding) launched in March 2024 with the Dencun upgrade and was the most significant Ethereum scaling improvement since The Merge. It introduced <strong style="color:#627EEA;">"blobs"</strong> — a new temporary data storage format specifically for L2 rollups that is 10–100x cheaper than calldata.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">The result: Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base fees dropped by 90–99% overnight — from dollars to fractions of a cent per transaction. L2 TVL surged past $40B. EIP-4844 is the foundation for full danksharding, which will eventually allow Ethereum to process millions of TPS across its L2 ecosystem.</p>

        <p>A crypto wallet doesn't actually store your crypto — your coins live on the blockchain. The wallet stores your <strong style="color:#627EEA;">private key</strong>, which proves ownership and allows you to sign transactions. Lose your private key = lose access forever. There's no customer support, no password reset, no bank to call.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">Types: Hot wallets (MetaMask, Phantom) are connected to the internet — convenient but less secure. Cold wallets (Ledger, Trezor) are hardware devices that store private keys offline — the Ethereum security standard. The seed phrase (12-24 words) is the master backup that can regenerate any wallet. Guard it like your life savings depend on it — because they do.</p>

        <p><strong style="color:#627EEA;">DeFi (Decentralized Finance)</strong> is a collection of financial services — lending, borrowing, trading, earning interest — built on smart contracts with no banks or brokers. Anyone with a wallet can access DeFi, 24/7, from anywhere in the world, with no KYC, no credit checks, and no account minimum.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">Key DeFi protocols: Uniswap (DEX, $1T+ traded), Aave (lending/borrowing), MakerDAO (stablecoin DAI), Compound (yield), and Curve (stable swaps). The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi peaked at $180B in November 2021. The risk: smart contract bugs can lead to total fund loss — always verify audits before depositing.</p>

        <p>A <strong style="color:#627EEA;">DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation)</strong> is an organisation governed entirely by smart contracts and token-holder voting — no CEO, no board, no human gatekeepers. Proposals are submitted on-chain, token holders vote, and approved actions execute automatically via smart contract.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">Ethereum hosts the largest DAOs by value: MakerDAO (governs DAI stablecoin, $5B+ collateral), Uniswap DAO (governs $6B+ DEX), Compound DAO (governs $2B+ lending protocol), and Arbitrum DAO (governs the L2 treasury). <strong style="color:#627EEA;">$25B+ of assets are governed by Ethereum DAOs</strong> with no human administrators required — pure on-chain code execution.</p</div>

        <p>The Bitcoin blockchain itself has never been successfully hacked in 15+ years. Each block uses SHA-256 encryption and is linked cryptographically to all previous blocks. Shutting it down would require simultaneously taking offline thousands of independent nodes across 100+ countries — practically impossible.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">What <em>can</em> be hacked: smart contracts (Euler Finance: $197M, 2023), bridges (Ronin Bridge: $625M, 2022), centralized exchanges (FTX: $32B collapse, 2022), and phishing attacks stealing private keys. The blockchain layer is secure — the applications and human behavior on top of it are where the risk lies.</p>

        <p>A <strong style="color:#627EEA;">stablecoin</strong> is a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset — usually the US dollar. They solve the volatility problem: you get blockchain's speed and borderlessness with a $1 = $1 guarantee. Types: Fiat-backed (USDT, USDC — backed by real dollars in a bank), Crypto-backed (DAI — overcollateralized with ETH), Algorithmic (failed spectacularly with TerraUSD/UST — $40B wiped in 72 hours, May 2022).</p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">Total stablecoin market cap: $160B+. They're the backbone of DeFi, the primary settlement layer for crypto trades, and increasingly used for cross-border payments in high-inflation economies like Argentina, Turkey, and Nigeria.</p>
